How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff between the two versions outlined sections that had been modified and 
    this made it easier to find the error in the two files
    
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps efficiency in the long term by
    removing the need to search through a long file
    for a recent error. You can simply return to a previous
    working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    I can commit every important change
    Cons:
    There is the chance that i forget to commit
    an important change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Versions like Git allow saving multiple files in 
    one commit because it is more programmer oriented
    while versions like Google Docs are for more everyday use

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides a record of all commits made
    then using the ids from the git log you can find the
    differences using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives the confidence to make large changes
    because i dont have to spend hours looking for
    an error or having to start again. i can just revert
    to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try ussing git to monitor
    changes in my projects so that i can keep 
    track of them
